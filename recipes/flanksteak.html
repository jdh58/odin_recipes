    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 cup molasses</li>
        <li>1 (1 1/2 pound) trimmed beef flank stead</li>
        <li>1/3 cup white vinegar</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground caayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li>1 teapsoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup strong beer</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Pour ketchup, molasses, and white vinegar in a bowl;
            add white sugar, 2 teaspoons black pepper, 1
            teaspoon salt, cayenne pepper, cumin, allspice, and
            cinnamon. Whisk until sauce is smooth. Pour in beer.</li>
        <li>Place flank steak into a non-reactive container; pour
            sauce over meat. Poke at least 100 holes per side in
            the flank steak using 2 forks.</li>
        <li>Cover container with plastic wrap and marinate beef 8
            to 12 hours (up to overnight).</li>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly
            oil the grate. Season flank steak with salt and black
            pepper.</li>
        <li>Grill flank steak for 2 1/2 minutes; turn meat around
            on grate to a 45-degree angle to make diamond grill
            marks; grill for 2 1/2 more minutes. Repeat on second
            side, turning meat 45 degrees after 2 1/2 minutes and
            grilling 2 1/2 more minutes.</li>
        <li>Flip steak to original side and paint meat with
            sauce. Continue to grill until sauce has glazed onto
            the meat, about 30 seconds. Turn meat over and brush
            other side with sauce. Sauce will burn if cooked too
            long. Repeat 1 more time, brushing and glazing sauce
            onto meat for about 30 seconds on each side. An
            instant-read meat thermometer, inserted into the
            thickest part of the flank steak, should read 125
            degrees F (52 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Transfer steak to a platter and let rest 5 to 10
            minutes before slicing lengthwise down the center;
            cut each half across the grain into slices about 3/8
            inch thick. Drizzle slices with more sauce to serve.
        </li>
    </ol>
